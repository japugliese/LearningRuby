#ex3: Numbers and Math
#Study Drills:
#1.Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
#2.Remember in Exercise 0 when you started irb? Start irb this way again and, using the math operators, use Ruby as a calculator.
#3.Find something you need to calculate and write a new .rb file that does it.
#4.Rewrite ex3.rb to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.

puts "Hens #{25 + 30 / 6}"
puts "Now I will count the eggs:"

puts 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

puts "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

puts 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

puts "What is 3 + 2? #{3 + 2}"
puts "What is 5 - 7? #{5 - 7}"

puts "Oh, that's why it's false."

puts "How about some more."

puts "Is it greater? #{5 > 2}"
puts "Is it greater or equal? #{5 >= -2}"
puts "Is it less or equal? #{5 <= -2}"
